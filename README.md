# Abstract

This application is a Twitter-like social network for making posts and following users. It is implemented with _HTML_, _CSS_, _JavaScript_, _Bootstrap_, _Python_, _Django_ and the _SQLite_ database. Signed in users can _write_ new text-based posts, _edit_ and _delete_ their own posts, _like_ or _unlike_ posts,  _comment_ on posts,  and _delete_ any comment written by themselves as well. Through the navbar, the user can access _all posts_ from all users, its _profile_ page, posts from _followers_, and posts from users that he or she is _following_ as well. Furthermore, ckicking on the username of any post leads to the profile page of that user. All pages use a basic pagination technique that limits the number of posts that are displayed (10).
